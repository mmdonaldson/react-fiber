NOTES
- react 16
- is fiber ready yet
- react has always been a push rather than pull (declarative) but hasn't taken real advantage of it
- the ability to prioritise updates
- the ability to pause an update if something higher priority is waiting
- multiple elements can be returned
- target multiple dom nodes declaratively rather than imperatively
- error boundaries - there will be a specific lifecycle hook for handling errors on a component
- not so much about performance, fiber is about being responsive in the UI
- single data structure called fiber which describes the work, while loop, little-no recursion, not many language performance features. keeping like c, really simple
- ability to build a custom renderer, currently have to fork a few things and it gets messy
